# Instructions on how to build on your local machine:

If you don't have Node installed, [download Node here](https://nodejs.org/en)

This project uses Node Version >= 18.16.0

After installation, run `npm install` to install dependencies

Once installation has finished, run `npm start` to start the project

# Changing/Adding behavior

I have set up the frontend in a way that will proxy requests to a server on localhost:5000, so test servers should be running on that

If you'd like to change that port, go into package.json and change that "proxy" attribute to whatever you want

The config.js file has several variables and endpoints that can be changed to test the app, as well as change its behavior

For instance, the actual endpoint urls and names can be changed, as well as using mock data to test if the app works as expected
